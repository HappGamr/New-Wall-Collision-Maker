# Hap-s-New-Wall-Collision-Maker
PLEASE create a backup file of your game before using running this script in the command bar. This script creates new collisions for ‘walls’ if their thickness is below or equal to a certain vector, etc. You can run this script in the command bar, place it in a new script in ServerScriptService if you want it to run when the game is played, or do both if needed.

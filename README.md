# Hap-s-New-Wall-Collision-Maker
- PLEASE create a back-up file of or save your game if you are going to run this script in the command bar in the event that your roblox studio freezes. 
- This script creates new collisions for ‘walls’ if their thickness is below or equal to a certain vector, etc. You can run this script in the command bar, place it in a new script in ServerScriptService if you want it to run when the game is played, or do both if needed.
